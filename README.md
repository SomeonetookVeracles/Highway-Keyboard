I'm building a minimalistic keyboard, something simple and stripped down. It's my first time working on a large PCB, and I kept getting distracted by feature creep and add-ons. So I'm going back to basics. I want this to be a barebones board that helps me sharpen my skills and really dial in the core of what makes a great keyboard.

I learned a lot while doing this, and explored concepts like impedence matching and zones, something that I've done before but never really had to prioritize.

If I do this again, I'm using a ESP-32 chip, making a CPU clock with decoupling capacitors was exhausting and annoyed me to no small extent lmao.
